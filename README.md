<h3>Course Communication</h3>
Course website: https://github.com/rlieberman/CG214-2017<br/>
[Course Google group] (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cg-214-spring-17)

This is a group email list that we'll use for class communication in both my sections of CG-214 this Spring. <br/>

The purpose of this list is for course-related announcements, discussion and questions. Feel free to share web-related links, articles and inspiration. This is also a great place to ask questions about what you're working on or things you're struggling with technically. You may of course email me individually, but most likely someone else in the class has the same question so it's a great way to learn from each other.<br/>

We'll use it as a group across both sections 102 and 103. I will communicate section-specific announcements separately.<br/>

# Course Description 

This 15-week course introduces students to the basics of web design and programming for the web. Students will work primarily with HTML and CSS to build the structural and visual components of a website, using CSS to integrate interaction and animation. In the second half of the semester, students will be introduced to other libraries for responsive design (Bootstrap) and languages (JavaScript) to create more complex, interactive websites.

<b>By the end of the course, students should be able to:</b>
* Write HTML to create the structural foundation of a website, and use it at an intermediate level
* Style websites with CSS, and make websites dynamic with CSS transitions 
* Create a unique website based on their own designs and visual ideas, considering key aspects of visual systems, interaction and user experience
* Debug their work and know how to search for necessary documentation or supplemental information
* Use Github and Github Pages to post homework
* Know the basic technical vocabulary of the front-end web, so that they can pursue more advanced web programming; this includes understanding the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript and being able to read the HTML / CSS of other websites using browser’s developer tools
* Incorporate libraries such as Bootstrap to create responsive designs
* Develop a critical vocabulary for looking at and talking about web experiences<br/>
<br/>

# Work and Requirements
<h3>Course Deliverables</h3>
<b>1. Weekly Homework</b><br/>
Each week you’ll have a homework assignment that requires mastery of the material we covered in class the week before. These will be primarily design and technical exercises, with an occasional reading assignment. <br/>

Homework assignments <b>must be posted on GitHub by 5pm on Wednesday evenings,</b> so that I have enough time to look them over before class.

<b>2. Presentation: Website Design Review (1 person per week)</b><br/>
Every student will have to give an individual 7-10 minute presentation on a website that you feel is interesting, groundbreaking and innovative. You’ll talk about the design, concept, messaging, navigation and usability.

There will be at least 1 student presenting per week, depending on the number of students in the class. 

Please sign up for a presentation week according to what section you are in:
* [Section 102 (9AM) Presentation Signup] (https://github.com/rlieberman/CG214-2017/wiki/Presentation-Signup:-Section-103-(11AM))
* [Section 103 (11AM) Presentation Signup]

<b>3. Midterm Project</b><br/>
Your midterm project will be a website responding to one of the following assignment prompts:
* An interactive self portrait
* A piece of hypertext narrative
* A redesign of an existing site
There will be a set of additional technical requirements you must meet for this assignment, to be reviewed later in the semester.

<b>4. Final Project</b><br/>
Your final project will be full-scale website design and implementation that can either be a development of your midterm or a portfolio site for yourself. Unlike the midterm, which is a shorter assignment, we will go through a full design process of sketching, wireframing, designing and then building out this site.

<hr/>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of each class.

This class meets for 1 hour and 50 minutes per week. We have a ton of material to cover, so come on time.  Students who come in later than 30 minutes after the class started will be marked absent.

<b>If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend a class, email me beforehand.</b>

* 3 unexcused latenesses = one absence. 
* 3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-). 
* More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade. 

The full academic calendar is <a href="https://www.fitnyc.edu/registrar/academic-calendar/">here for your reference.</a>
<hr/>
<h3>Participation</h3>
Participation is imperative in this class. You are expected to engage actively in class discussions, presentations and technical demos. We have a lot of material to cover, so please come each week prepared to pay attention and participate actively in class. <br/>

Asking questions is highly encouraged. There are no stupid questions; if you have a question, most likely somebody else in the room has the same one.
<hr/>
<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
Students will be assessed on both technical skills as well as critical thinking, creativity and presentation. Grades are based on completion and quality of projects, homework assignments, class participation and attendance. Assignment due dates are hard dates, which means points will be deducted for late assignments and homework. <br/>

<b>Final grades in the course will reflect the following:

* Participation and Attendance - 20%
* Weekly homework assignments - 20%
* Website presentation - 10%
* Midterm Project - 20%
* Final Project - 30%
</b>

<b>And in general, grades are determined according to the following breakdown:</b>
* A = 90-100%, excellent work 
* B = 80-89%, above average work 
* C= 70-79%, average or competent work 
* D = 60-69%, below average work 
* F = 0-59%, unsatisfactory work

<b>Please note:</b> Assignments must be posted on GitHub by 5pm on Wednesday evenings, so that I have enough time to look them over before class. 5% will be deducted per late assignment per day.<br/>

# Course Policies
As an instructor, and part of FIT,  I am committed to maintaining a positive learning environment where people can safely ask questions, engage in thoughtful discussion and challenge themselves both academically and creatively. <br/>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
Academic integrity is a serious thing. Please read over <a href="https://www.fitnyc.edu/policies/academic-affairs/academic-honor-code.php">FIT’s Academic Honor Code here.</a> 

In the world of programming, sharing and repurposing code is often encouraged. It’s fine to look at other people’s code or refer to examples, but be sure to always give credit and acknowledge your sources.

<hr/>

<h3>Disability</h3>

Students with learning, hearing, visual, physical/mobility, and medical disabilities are invited to meet with the staff of FIT-ABLE, the College’s Office of Disability Services in A570 or call 212.217.4090.

<h3>Discrimination and Harassment</h3>

Discrimination and harassment are behaviors that are incompatible with the standard of conduct required of a member of the FIT community in the workplace or in any college-related setting, including but not limited to off-campus, college-related events and activities. <a href="https://www.fitnyc.edu/policies/college/nondiscrimination.php">More information on the FIT website here.</a><br/>
