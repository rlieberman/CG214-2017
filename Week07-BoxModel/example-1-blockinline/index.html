				<h1>Here is an h1 element. As you can see from this red outline, h1 is a block level element.</h1>
				<br/><br/>
				<p>Here is a paragraph element. Paragraphs are also block elements which you can see from this blue outline.</p>

				<div class="child">Here's a div inside a div. Remember that a div will start a new line and stretch to take up the width of its parent element if no width is specified. We can see this here by the orange outline that spans the entire width of our white container.</div>
				<br/><br/>
				<div>Unlike divs, <span>span elements</span> are inline elements. This means they take up only as much width as necessary. You can see this by the green outline around it. This makes span elements great for styling text within other block elements such as paragraphs. </div>
