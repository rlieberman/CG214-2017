      The Toronto Blue Jays are literally the best team ever. I'm not a huge sports fan, but some of my oldest memories are watching the Blue Jays with my grandpa and my dad. I remember watching Dave Stieb's no hitter (the only one in Blue Jays history) at the family's summer cottage in 1990.

        And this year, they made it to the wild card game against the Baltimore Orioles. They beat them in an exciting game, and then crushed the Texas Rangers in the Divisional Series. They face elimination against Cleveland, but they're not done yet!
